--------------- v2.0 ---------------
Main features:
+ Completely redesigned the app
+ Skins are now shown in a grid: tap and hold a skin to upload it quickly!
+ You can now search for new skins directly in the app
+ Reworked iPad version that is now fully enjoyable
+ Added a few settings to force the app in english, disable iCloud and sort skins by date

Bug fixes and minor improvements:
* Supporting security questions for Mojang accounts, this should fix issues with uploading skins
* More accurate error messages when failing to upload a skin
* Fix when editing a skin's info
* Fix adding certain skins from an URL
* Improve iAd behavior, should be less intrusive
* Lots and lots of memory improvements, bug fixes and other small stuff!

The search function is provided by skinmanager.fr.nf: if you want to make a skin available to all the other users of SkinSwitch, check them out!
The translations were updated as well as we could, but still not perfect: you can still freely contribute on sswitch.tr.outadoc.fr.
